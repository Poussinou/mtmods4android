    <string name="disclaimer_2_m">The mods listed as available are a subset of the mods found
        on the Minetest forums. When you download a mod, you do not download it from our servers
        but rather from the original link that the author posted. Because of this,
        we cannot guarantee mods are safe. No one in particular checks these mods.</string>

    <string name="disclaimer_3_t">What can you do?</string>
    <string name="disclaimer_3_m">If you\'re unsure about the safety of a mod, check its
        forum topic. Look at how old the thread is, and what the comments say.</string>

    <string name="disclaimer_4_t">Well Known Authors</string>
    <string name="disclaimer_4_m">One of the features of this app is to label well known,
        popular mod makers as such. The aim of this is for recommendation, rather
        than for security reasons. Whilst these authors are more trustworthy than most,
        there is still a possibility of their accounts being
        hacked and bad downloads being placed there instead.</string>
